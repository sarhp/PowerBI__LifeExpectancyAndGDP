Out of a total of 189, countries 31 belongs to the OECD
> Asia compromises 59% of the world’s population, totaling 31bn people.
    
> Europe accounts for 20%, with population of 10bn.
    
> Africa and the Americans have populations of similar sizes.

- Over time, trends in life expectancy, GDP, and population growth have evolved significantly.

- Around 1990, disparities among regional groups in terms of development became increasingly noticeable. 

- Europe consistently led in both life expectancy and GDP, while Africa recorded the lowest figures across these metrics.

- Europe consistently maintained the highest life expectancy globally.

- Since the 2000s, Asia and the Americas have been narrowing the gap and catching up.

- Europe maintained the highest GDP as well.

- During the 1950s, there was rapid economic growth globally, with Asia beginning to catch up to Europe.

- Population growth has been less significant in most regions, except for Asia - starting from the 1950s, Asia experienced exponential population growth, reaching over 70M people.

- Positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy indicates countries with higher GDP tend to have higher life expectancy.

- However, there is a point where improvements in life expectancy remains plateau even GDP continues to increase - this could be due to a higher GDP can improve living conditions like healthcare, but doesn’t necessarily guarantee continued gains in life expectancy beyond a certain level.

- Higher income levels consistently correlate with higher life expectancy across all regions, while lower income levels are associated with reduced life expectancies.

- Europe has the most high-level income earners (note that there’s no data for ‘low’ income).

- Africa has fewer high/mid-level income earners, bur larger proportion of low-income earners.

- In Asia & Americas, mid-income earners are prevalent, with some high-income earners.
